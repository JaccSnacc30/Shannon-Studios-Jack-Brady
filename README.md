Shannon Recreation Status Dashboard.

This system has the capacity to minimise or even eliminate fully water related accidents and deaths by making data more accessible

How can real-time data sources be integrated into a single, location-aware safety system for recreational activities along the Shannon River?

Expected Outcomes:
An app that says whether you should or should not participate in water based recreational activities on The River Shannon.

Difficulty:
Intermediate to Advanced

The Scope:
The River Shannon and potentially surrounding bodies of water. 

Use public data like:
OPW water level API,
EPA Bathing Water API,
Waterways Ireland Marine Notices.
Met Eireann
Health Alert API

To create a system that will allow users to easily and effectively find out the suitability of The River Shannon for recreational activities like, but not limited to, swimming, rowing, sailing, etc. This dashboard should take into effect variables like temperature, current speed in certain locations, water levels, weather, etc. This data should be shown in an intuitive way, furthermore the system may encourage users to go to more safe locations that can be ascertained with the data from the API.
